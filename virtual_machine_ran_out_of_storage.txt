Problem : vm ran out of storage
cause : i failed to predict how much storage the vm acutally needs
extra : the / partition uses LVM
solution :
1/ added a storage device to the virtual machine
2/
lsblk #to see info of storaeg devics
pvcreate /dev/extra-physical-volume-to-add #create a physical volume
vgs #to see the volume groups
vgextend volume-group-name /dev/physical-volume-name #to add the physical volume to the volume group
lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/sda/root #to add the free space(the physical volume that we added to the volume group) to the logical volume that we need to extend
xfs_growfs /dev/sda/root #to extend the file system of that logical volume
df -n #to check if the volume got extended
